<h3 id="nodesarchitecture">Nodes Architecture</h3>

<p>Jupiter implements a centralized architecture, with each client node communicating with the main server. This server has for purpose to centralize the actions, coordinate the clients and ensure the consistency.</p>

<p>To the server, each client appears to be operating synchronously with respect to the server’s actions. The server can thus use a simple change propagation algorithm to keep all the clients updated and in sync.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.github.com/Aldream/notepal/gh-pages/images/architecture.png" alt="Jupiter Architecture" title="" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: it is possible to merge the HTML and the REST server by editing the config file, for instance when there is only one port available.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We this differentiate two kind of nodes in this architecture:
- the <em>Master</em> node, ie. the central server/coordinator
- the multiple <em>Client</em> nodes, which are running the edition application</p>

<h3 id="consistencyalgorithm">Consistency Algorithm</h3>

<p>Jupiter consistency algorithm is based on the <em>optimistic concurrency control</em> heuristic, which requires no communication with the coordinator before applying changes locally. Those changes are applied immediately, while the other parties of the action are getting informed.</p>

<p>If more than one participant makes a change at the same time, a conﬂict resolution algorithm is applied. This algorithm transforms the local operations to non-conflicting ones, so that every party can move to the same final state.</p>

<p>These transformations are assured by the function <em>xform</em>, which takes as parameters the local (and thus already applied) operation O<small>l</small> and the incoming one O<small>i</small>, and returns the 2 transformed operations O<small>l</small>' and O<small>i</small>'. The party thus only have to apply O<small>i</small>' to reach the consistent and final state.</p>

<p>The transformations applied by <em>xform</em> over the operations are defined for each couple of potential conflicting operations. (see <a href="https://github.com/Aldream/docpal/wiki/Operations-&amp;-Transformation-Rules">Operations &amp; Transformation Rules</a>).</p>
